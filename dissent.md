We want to give room to dissent and not oppress it. If we don't allow differing
opinions to be voiced then we are not going to get diverse opinions. We will
only allow the same people and the same opinions to surface. And so we need to
normalise dissent.

On the flip side of this, we don't want to allow dissent to stop a plan that has
been agreed on. The opinion should be noted and it can be reviewed along the
life of the plan that was made. Maybe they were right and this can be fed back
into the plan, or it was wrong and it's not a big deal.
