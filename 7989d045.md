In [An Engineering Argument for Basic Income][ubi], Scott Santens makes a very
interesting link between Universal Basic Income (UBI) and fault tolerance. They
argue that UBI acts as a fault tolerant system for our finance. It moderates our
ability to live and survive in this economical world. When we're employed we're
paying taxes that balance out the UBI, when we're part-time it tends towards
half-and-half, and when we're unemployed then we don't pay any taxes and still
have money to survive.
