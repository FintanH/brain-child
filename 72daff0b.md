In the tech zeitgeist you'll often hear about "Fail Fast and Break Things" and
"Iterate". At the heart of these ideas is building something, examining what's
good and bad about it, and refining the output to get to the final product. This
sounds great. We get to try things out quickly and get feedback on the pros and
cons of the approach.

This approach falls on its head, however, when it's also paired with a sunken
cost mindset. Developers, myself included, have an internal affinity to work we
produce. It's hard to delete something, especially when it _seems_ like it's
working. But here's the rub, that first prototype we built is not the perfect
product. Its components need to be examined and we need to ask ourselves "What's
wrong with it?" and "How can it be improved?" We then delete any of the cruft
that's getting in the way of our code being the best it can be.

This also goes for code that someone else wrote. Sometimes we come across some
code that we perceive as working and we're afraid to make any drastic changes to
it. But if it's not working as desired then evaluate why that is. Dig into that
piece of code to understand it and critique it so that you can come up with a
better version of it -- or maybe even a completely new solution.

Don't move fast and break things, move fast and break things.
