# Historical

* Recursion found in ancient and medieval mathematics
* Fibonacci numbers
    - Leonardo of Pisa
    - introduced in Liber Abaci
    - example of population genetics
    - rabbits mating
* Recursion provided foundations for arithmetic today
    - Addition & multiplication defined recursively
    - Thank you Grassmann and Pierce -
      https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/recursive-functions/notes.html#note-1
    - Proved the laws: associative, commutative, and distributive
* Dedekind coined "definiton by recursion" in "Was sing und was sollen die
  Zahlen" (1888)
* The natural numbers defined recursively
    - Thank you Peano
    - axiomatization of numbers
* Recursion schemes makes an appearance:
     > Hilbert first described a logical calculus for finitary number theory
     > including “recursion and intuitive induction for finite totalities” in
     > (1923, 1139).[4] Although this presentation also included a discussion of
     > definition by simultaneous recursion, a more extensive treatment of what
     > we would now recognize as recursion schemes is given in his well known
     > paper “On the infinite” (1926). This includes a discussion of what
     > Hilbert calls ordinary recursion (which is similar to Skolem’s
     > description of primitive recursion), transfinite recursion, as well as
     > recursion at higher types. This treatment makes clear that Hilbert and
     > his collaborators had taken substantial steps towards developing a
     > general theory of recursive definability. Ultimately, however, the
     > influence of Hilbert’s presentations was diminished in light of the more
     > precise formulation of primitive recursion which Gödel would soon
     > provide.[5]
