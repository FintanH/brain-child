Two recommended approaches for merging from a colleague are:

1. While on the _topic branch_, `git rebase -i --autosquash origin/<main>`, then
   `git  merge` on the `<main>`, and push. **Note** during the rebase you can
   get conflicts, **make sure to build before merging again**.
2. On the `<main>` branch, `git merge --squash <topic branch>`, followed by `git
   commit -v`.
