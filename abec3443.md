While reading [From Vim to Emacs in 14 days][vim-emacs] I came across a way of
managing packages, called [use-package][use-package].

The `use-package` README states that the ways install are:

> Either clone from this GitHub repository or install from MELPA (recommended).

I wasn't aware what [MELPA][melpa], but it turned out it was stated in the post
in the first place!

So I installed `use-package` by running `M-x package-install RET use-package`.
And here I go!
