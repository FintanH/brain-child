It seems obvious that if there are many diverse ideas to answer a single
question that the probability you find a good answer increases. The diverse
ideas get to go into the pot, mix together, make strong connections and produce
a better answer compared to one single idea.

When a group wants to answer a question -- or questions -- then each individual
can provide a unique outlook on how they would like to answer that question.
This is the **divergent phase**.

Then the group can take these ideas and analyze them during the **converging
phase**. Competing ideas will go head-to-head. Pros and cons will be pointed
out. Stronger ideas will form from the individual ideas and the group will come
up with a well defined solution together to implement.
