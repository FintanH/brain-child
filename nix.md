[Nix](nixos) has intrigued me for quite some time. I've been cargo culting it
for the past year or so and barely know the basics. My goal in these thoughts is
to solidify my knowledge here. I'm currently on a NixOS machine and I thought
that would force me to dive deeper -- but I'm still nowhere near the competency
level I'd like to be at.

I'm going to start off by going through the [Nix Pill](nix-pills) series and
distilling the knowledge from them here.
