I often find myself becoming interested in learning something new. This new
project allows me to enter a flow easily because I'm at the intersection of
challenge where something is not too easy and not too hard. What happens next is
that I have something I'm _supposed_ to be working on but my brain begins to
switch off this task and I find myself opening the other project. I call this
project my **procrasti-project**.

The tough part of this is that there's something I should be doing, but I'd
rather be working on this new thing. The other issue is that I often find new
things to play with.

The good thing is that entering this flow state allows me to learn something new
quite quickly and it's very enjoyable. It's productive procrastination.
