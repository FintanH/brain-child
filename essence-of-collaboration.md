Collaboration is based on the belief that others have something to offer. This
seems like a bit of a selfish viewpoint, but I think we end up being selfish no
matter what. Even when we're doing something for the good of another, we gain
happiness from this. But when we can collaborate with others this creates a net
positive of happiness.
