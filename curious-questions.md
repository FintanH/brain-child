The goal of curious questions is to avoid biasing any answers towards your point
of view. You're trying to invite the opinion of the other and lead to learning
on both sides. In Language is Leadership, Marquet outlines 7 old school
questioning methods and they're curious counterparts.

1. Stacking questions, effectively bombarding the person receiving the
   questions. Instead, we should be **one and done**.
2. Avoid the teaching moment and make it a **learning moment**.
3. Don't ask dirty questions -- questions that hide unconscious (or deliberate)
   biases. Ask a **clean question**.
4. Instead of binary questions, use **what** or **how**.
5. Instead of **why**, try **tell me more**.
6. Avoid self-affirming questions and use **self-educating** questions.
7. Don't jump to the future, instead **start with the present, past, and then
   the future**.
