Vote before discussing. This allows the team to get an inital weigh-in on their
choices before any bias sets in. As in [Questions with
Probability][[questions-with-probability]], the choices should be framed with
"How" questions.

Depending on the psychological safety of the group, different voting mechanisms
can be used. A safe vote is using probability cards. The card values are in the
range of 1, 5, 20, 50, 80, 95, and 99. People vote using one of these values
with their card face-down. After the vote is revealed the minority cluster can
be elaborated on.
