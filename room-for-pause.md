We should make room for pauses when working. This allows us to stop and think
which can prevent us from continuing down a wrong path.

To allow room for a pause, the people you are working with need to feel safe in
calling the pause. If they are ridiculed for stopping work then this will be
detrimental to being able to do it again.
