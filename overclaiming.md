In Leadership is Language, by L. David Marquet, he brings up the example of
**overclaiming**. This is the phenomenon where your biases make you think you
did more work than others. You have a clear idea of how much washing up you do
in your house compared to your housemates. So you think you're _always_ doing
the washing up. When everybody thinks this way, if asked how much work they do
the sum of the percentages will exceed 100%.

e.g. Housemate 1 says 70% of the housework and housemate 2 says 60% of the
housework.
