I've recently been watching a lot of videos on videogame design. One trope that
kept reappearing was the [Metroidvania][mv]. The concept is that players
explore, hit roadblocks, and inevitably must backtrack to explore further. In
[Metroid][metroid] the setup is usually Samus by herself.

I'm starting to think about how this design might be incorporated into a DnD
adventure -- possibly a one-shot. A party could be stranded in a dungeon, city,
or any other area. If they are split up -- the lone element of Metroid -- then
it could be interesting for them to solve puzzles and hear about clues that
would be relevant to others. As we rotate through the party it becomes important
for the player taking their turn to explore as much as possible, while the
others have to _actively_ listen for clues that may be relevant to their
puzzles.

To keep the progression engaging, there could be mini-battles and mini-bosses
that are easy to fell for one or two party members.

Their progression ultimately leads them all into a shared room, where the final
battle awaits them.
