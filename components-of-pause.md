The components that give way to giving a pause are:

- Setting a clear check-in point
- Setting a clear channel of communication
- Allowing questions of dissent during the pause period

The first forces the team to take a pause period by setting one in advance. The
second gives the team a channel to call the pause in. The final one allows the
team question the current path, giving strength to team members opinions and
thinking.
