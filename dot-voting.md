When given many options to choose from, dot voting means that people are given a
number of votes to distribute on their favoured options. For example, if there
were 6 options to choose from, the voters would get 2 votes to give out. You
then examine where the options landed. As part of [Collaborative
Voting][[collaborative-voting], the group would understand the minority as well
as the majority.
