In [Components of Giving a Pause][[components-of-pause]], one of the components
was a clear channel. This can be complemented with a mechanism for giving pause.
This could be a phrase, or a physical action (pulling a cord is used in Toyota).

To boost the psychological safety of doing this, the person calling the pause
should be thanked -- as opposed to shunned. It gives team members the chance to
check-in if they're on the right path -- rather than struggling by themselves.
