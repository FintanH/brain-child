These days every house has a variety of machines and appliances. There's tvs,
washing machines, dishwashers, etc. The majority of us own laptops, a few own
desktops. But very few of us own home servers.

Perhaps this is because we haven't shown a use for a server for each home? We
put all our data in the cloud for convenience, but what if that power was in the
hands of the consumer? Being able to store your own data on your own machine.
Being able tinker with applications that are personal to you.

As the decentralized web starts to push itself into the zeitgeist, maybe a
server per home will become a norm in our society.
